      "description": "In an age where AI powers our phones and cars drive themselves, elite cybersecurity consultants at Digital Encode still spend their evenings wrestling with Word documents and spreadsheets.",
      "current_state": "Your team of brilliant security experts – who can find vulnerabilities that automated scanners miss and craft social engineering campaigns that slip past the most vigilant defenses – spends nearly half their time not on their craft, but on documentation."

    "current_state_of_work": {
      "title": "THE CURRENT STATE OF WORK",
      "description": "The reality at Digital Encode reflects a stark contrast: elite-class security expertise bottlenecked by tools better suited to the last decade.",
      "consultant_workload": "Your consultants juggle between 1–4 clients simultaneously, each requiring the same meticulous attention to detail in both testing and documentation.",
      "report_writing": "A single week of penetration testing can spawn another week of report writing – not because the insights are lacking, but because transforming technical discoveries into clear, actionable client recommendations remains a stubbornly manual process that’s reliant on the multiple hats of your talented team."

    "technical_assessments": {
      "title": "Technical Assessments",
      "description": "When your team conducts technical assessments, they put together insights from a plethora of specialized tools: Burp Suite revealing application vulnerabilities, Nessus/Qualys scanning for network weaknesses, and let’s not forget the hundreds of specialized tools on Kali Linux.",
      "tool_outputs": "Each tool speaks its own language, with outputs that must be manually translated, correlated, and contextualized.",

    "social_engineering_assessments": {
      "title": "Social Engineering Assessments",
      "description": "Your social engineering assessments showcase similar paradoxes. Your consultants craft sophisticated campaigns that can bypass the mental defenses of security-conscious teams.",
      "infrastructure_setup": "Yet the infrastructure setup for these campaigns – from domain acquisition to email configuration, from website cloning to campaign tracking – consumes precious time that could be spent refining the actual social engineering strategy."
